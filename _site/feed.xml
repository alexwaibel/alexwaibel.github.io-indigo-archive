For the past few years I’ve used Arch on everything. However, I decreasingly feel like tinkering with my Linux installs and would prefer just to have sane defaults so I’ve decided now is as good a time as any to give Ubuntu a spin. Ubuntu ships with Gnome, which is my preferred desktop environment for my laptop anyway (I have a 2-in-1 and Gnome is most touch friendly in my experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Macbook Pros at my past few jobs and have come to really enjoy the aesthetics of Mac OS. I’ve wrestled a lot with whether or not I should migrate to a Macbook but have ultimately decided that I prefer Linux and the keyboards of other laptops. As I’ve been exploring various Gnome shell themes, I’ve come to a realization: the only themes I really like are blatant ripoff themes of Mac OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that I also came to appreciate Linux even more. What keeps me from converting fully to Mac OS is the lack of choice. There’s certain behaviors of the window management specifically that I find annoying. I can’t change them though because the entire operating system is so locked down. With my newly themed Ubuntu, I feel like I have the best of both worlds. There are certainly things I still can’t immitate that my work Macs do so well. Namely, the trackpad on my work Mac is much better than the one on my personal Thinkpad.  At the end of the day, I think I’ve finally reached a point where my laptop looks sufficiently good and I can ignore tinkering with it further for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to revamp my personal website. I was previously running my own web server on a raspberry pi but decided it would be easier to host everything on Github Pages. At the same time, I wanted to redo my website, which was previously just a stylized version of my resume, and add a blog component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s powering everything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github Pages for hosting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll for static site generation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jekyll Admin for easy content management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Staticman for comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
