<p>I'm a software engineer finishing a bachelor's in computer science from
Ohio State. I've also interned at Microsoft and Amazon and I'll be returning
to Seattle after I graduate. Note the opionons expressed on this blog are my
own.</p>

<p>Outside of work I'm super into music. I especially like post rock and hip
hop. I'm also crazy about coffee, keyboards, guitar, and video games.</p>
