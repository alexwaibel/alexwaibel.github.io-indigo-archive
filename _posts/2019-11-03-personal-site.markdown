I recently decided to revamp my personal website. I was previously running my own web server on a raspberry pi but decided it would be easier to host everything on Github Pages. At the same time, I wanted to redo my website, which was previously just a stylized version of my resume, and add a blog component.

What's powering everything?

- Github Pages for hosting
- Jekyll for static site generation
- Jekyll Admin for easy content management
- Staticman for comments
